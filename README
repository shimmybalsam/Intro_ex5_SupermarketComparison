=  Description: =

One program which defines different functions which compare between prices
of products in different supermarket across the country, in order to find the
cheapest supermarkets to buy at, per chosen product\s, or in general.

More specifically, the program can load XML files, create it's own sub-files
out of the XML files, and load whichever of the files the user chooses.

Furthermore, the program allows the user to filter out and choose specific
products he is interested in, within said files, and compare only their prices
at the different supermarkets he chose.

Once completed, this programmed can be imported by a 'gui' program for
activation and will show the cheapest option in red.
